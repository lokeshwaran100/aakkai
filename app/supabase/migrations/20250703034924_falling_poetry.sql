  # Fix member_projects RLS Policy

  1. Changes
    - Drop all existing policies on member_projects table
    - Create a universal policy that allows all operations for authenticated users
    - This matches the approach used for team_members table

  2. Security
    - Enables RLS on member_projects table
    - Allows all operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) for authenticated users
    - Uses USING (true) and WITH CHECK (true) to bypass restrictions for development
